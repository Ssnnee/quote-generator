# Quote Generator

### Description
The Quote Generator is a simple and intuitive website that generates quotes at the click of a button.
It also provides the functionality to tweet these quotes directly from the application, providing an easy way to share your favorite quotes on social media.

## Usage
Using the Quote Generator is straightforward. Once you've navigated to the website, you'll see a button labeled 'Generate Quote'.
Clicking this button will generate a new quote and display it on the screen. If you find a quote that you'd like to share on Twitter,
simply click the 'Tweet Quote' button, and you will be redirected to Twitter with a pre-populated tweet containing the quote.

## Code
The Quote Generator is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quotes are fetched from an API, and the Twitter functionality is implemented using Twitter's Web Intents.
